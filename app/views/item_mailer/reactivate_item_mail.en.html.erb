<p>Hi <%= @item.owner_name %>,</p>

<p>
  Your <%= @item.class.model_name.human %> on Berheim <i><%= @item.title %></i> has not been edited since a month and
  will therefore be hidden from now on.
  If it still should be active, click on this <%= link_to 'link', reactivate_url(@token) %>, to reactivate it for another month.
  Otherwise, it will automatically be deleted in two months.
